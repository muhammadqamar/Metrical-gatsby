LEARN ABOUT YOUR CONSUMERS.
    </h1>
<p>
Metrical AI analyzes your consumersâ€™ behavior patterns on your online sites. This data is used to construct a behavioral model that continuously learns and improves itself.

<div className="box">
<h1>
IDENTIFY THE RIGHT TARGETS.
    </h1>
<p>
The behavioral model scores and determines which of your consumers are most likely to abandon and signals the conversion engine to engage.

</p>
   
</div>


<div className="box">
<h1>
ENGAGE WITH ABANDONING CONSUMERS.
    </h1>
<p>Once the conversion engine receives a signal of a pending abandonment, it selects targeted messaging that has the highest likelihood of converting the consumer. The conversion engine calculates not only which messages are most effective, but also which will maximize your margins.</p>

<div className="box">
<h1>
CONVERSION, RIGHT ON THE SPOT.
    </h1>
<p>Before consumers can depart they will see compelling messaging that incentivizes them to stay, buy and come back for more.</p>
   
</div>

<div className="box">
<h1>
INCREASE YOUR CONVERSION, INSTANTLY.
